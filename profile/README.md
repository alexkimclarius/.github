# Clarius SDK

Welcome to the Clarius SDK home; here you'll find various repositories for both [partners](https://github.com/clariusdev/.github/blob/main/partners.md) and researchers making use of Clarius technology for commercial solutions, signal processing, AI research, and more.

Change is Coming!
=================

These past few months, we've focused much time and energy into developing a platform for partners coming on as an OEM integrator or through our upcoming Marketplace platform. With these developments, a few key changes are coming that users should be aware of:
* The OEM API will be renamed **Solum API**. Function naming and other various enumerations and structures will thus follow suit.
* The new Solum API will support **iOS and Android** through various new frameworks.
* The **Cast API** will also support iPadOS and Android through various new frameworks, allowing mobile App development for our Marketplace partners
* The **Mobile API** will be deprecated as we focus on supporting Cast on mobile platforms. Unfortunately, Apple does not provide a good IPC solution on its mobile platforms (iOS and iPadOS), thus supporting an Android-only IPC solution would become redundant since Cast will be the go-to solution

Thank you again for all of the great feedback over the years, we're headed into new territory with these changes, as brand new commercial solutions will be deployed in conjunction with the great imaging of Clarius scanners. I'm sure we'll be learning even more, and we already have plans for some major updates once these initial changes are deployed.
